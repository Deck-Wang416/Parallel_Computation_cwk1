# Simple makefile for Coursework 1. Normaly you would not upload a makefile
# for this assignment, but if you do, ensure (a) the executable name is unchanged,
# and (b) it works on the Gradescope autograder (in particular, do not change the
# name of the C-compiler to something that only exists on your system).
